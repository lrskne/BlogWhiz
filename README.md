# BlogWhiz

Currently this is an empty Rails project! This is a project for learning more about Ruby on Rails, and will be developed over the next 8 weeks. 

So far this is the assignment: Think about what kind of app you are going to build throughout this 8-week course.  The default app will be a blog with many features added on as we go (so we would highly recommend doing this).... but if you are daring, you can create your own totally different kind of web app and follow along with the same principals we will introduce along the way for our blog application.

Edit your README to talk about your app, introducing it to the world and describing to developers how to work with your code.  Get creative with your Markdown. 

When you are finished, submit your GitHub.com URL here.
